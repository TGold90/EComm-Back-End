# EComm-Back-End

## Description

EComm-Back-End is a backend RESTful API for ecommerce. A user can update and interact with data from 3 tables: Category, Products and Tags.

## Usage

First, the user must create the database that will be used by entering mysql and sourcing the schema file. Second, the user must "use" the cretaed database.
Third, the user will seed the database by running "npm run seed" in the command line.
Fourth, the user will start the server by running "npm start".

Once these step have been completed and the server is live, the user can access and change data from the category table, the products table and the tags table.
Using insomnia, or any other API client, the user can submit Get, Post, Put and Delete requests to each dataset. This means a user can read data, create data, change data and destroy data.
